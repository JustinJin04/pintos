## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

    ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b


>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

    0xffff0

#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

```
read_sector:
    pusha
    sub %ax, %ax
    push %ax			# LBA sector number [48:63]
    push %ax			# LBA sector number [32:47]
    push %ebx			# LBA sector number [0:31]
    push %es			# Buffer segment
    push %ax			# Buffer offset (always 0)
    push $1				# Number of sectors to read
    push $16			# Packet size
    mov $0x42, %ah			# Extended read
    mov %sp, %si			# DS:SI -> packet
    int $0x13			# Error code in CF
    popa				# Pop 16 bytes, preserve flags
popa_ret:
    popa
    ret				# Error code still in CF
```
BIOS interrupt being used: int $0x13, related to disk I/O operations 

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

First, it tries to read master boot record(MBR) and check for MBR signature from hard disk(if failed, turn to next one). Then it check the disk partition whether it is bootable and is a pintos kernel partition. This was done by reading partition table on each disk.

```
# Is it a Pintos kernel partition?
cmpb $0x20, %es:4(%si)
jne next_partition

# Is it a bootable partition?
cmpb $0x80, %es:(%si)
je load_kernel
```

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

???????It would output"Not found" and notify BIOS that boot failed.
```
# Didn't find a Pintos kernel partition anywhere, give up.
call puts
.string "\rNot found\r"

# Notify BIOS that boot failed.  See [IntrList].
int $0x18
```

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

After the bootloader find the kernel and load it from sectors of disk to the memory, it extract the header of ELF (0x2000:0x18) representing the entry point of kernel code and jump to the location which stored in 0x20018. 
```
mov $0x2000, %ax
mov %ax, %es
mov %es:0x18, %dx
mov %dx, start
movw $0x2000, start + 2
ljmp *start
```

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
```
#0  palloc_get_page (flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO)) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113

>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
